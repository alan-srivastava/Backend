In app.js we defined a route for user registration using userRouter which is imported from user.routes.js. In user.routes.js, we defined a POST route "/register" that calls the registerUser function from user.controller.js when a request is made to that route. The registerUser function is wrapped with asyncHandler to handle
any asynchronous errors properly.


export {registerUser}; means we can allows multiple functions inside braces to use it into another file like import { registerUser, loginUser } from "./auth";
export default registerUser; means we can use only one function or variable at a time and import it into another file like import registerUser from import registerUser from "./auth";


Cloudinary Integration in Your Code:

Cloudinary is a cloud-based image/media storage service. Here's how it works in your app:

File Upload Flow:

User uploads files (avatar, coverImage) via multer
Files are temporarily stored locally on your server
Cloudinary SDK uploads them to the cloud
Key Files Involved:

cloudinary.js - Contains the upload logic
Uses cloudinary.uploader.upload() to send files to Cloudinary's servers
What Happens:

Files get stored on Cloudinary's CDN (Content Delivery Network)
You receive a public URL back (like http://res.cloudinary.com/dtktnla8e/image/upload/...)
This URL is saved in MongoDB instead of the actual file
Local temporary files are deleted after upload
Benefits:

No server storage needed - saves disk space
Fast delivery - CDN serves images globally
Easy image manipulation - Cloudinary can resize, crop, optimize
Scalable - handles unlimited uploads
In Your User Model:

avatar and coverImage fields store Cloudinary URLs
When user fetches their profile, they get the public image links
Images are always available via Cloudinary's servers
